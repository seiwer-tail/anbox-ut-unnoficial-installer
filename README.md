# Anbox - Ubuntu Touch Unnoficial Installer
Script for installing Anbox on Ubuntu Touch devices where there is no official installer support


Warning: To install Anbox, your system must have an Anbox support patch, this patch only allows installation if you have a patch but the anbox installer does not support your device

Thanks a lot for the help in fixing bugs and in general for help: truebibarub
